Pre-requisites:
1) dawg 1.2-release is used to simulate the sequences.
2) Phylip version 3.69 [http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/getme.html]
3) TOPD-fMtS version 3.3 [http://genomes.urv.es/topd]

The programs "dawg", "fitch" and "topd_v3.3.pl" are exprected to be in the path.

Running simulations:

1) Run the script "divsim.sh" to create config files with different levels of divergence.
2) Run the script "sagdivrunner.sh" to simulate and report the performance statistics. 

It is possible to modify the config files to allow for any tree topology, different number of trees, different levels of divergence etc.

Config file format:

probability_of_tree	tree_in_format_for_use_by_dawg
